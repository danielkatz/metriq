# Metriq

A high-performance TypeScript metrics collection library designed for heavy workloads. Metriq provides a modern, type-safe API for collecting and exposing metrics with exceptional performance characteristics.

## ‚ö° Performance

- **7.5x faster** than prom-client when exposing 1M timeseries
- Entirely non-blocking architecture
- Optimized for high-throughput scenarios
- Efficient memory usage with streaming exports

## üîë Key Features

- **Type-safe API**: Full TypeScript support with typed labels
- **High Performance**: Optimized for handling millions of timeseries
- **Non-blocking**: All operations are non-blocking by design
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming exports prevent memory spikes
- **Advanced Features**:
  - TTL for metrics
  - Dynamic labels
  - Streaming writer

## üì¶ Packages

- [`metriq`](metriq/README.md) - The core metrics collection and reporting library
- [`@metriq/express`](adapters/express/README.md) - Express middleware for Metriq

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
npm install metriq
```

```typescript
import { metriq } from 'metriq';

// Initialize metrics
const metrics = metriq();

// Create a counter with typed labels
type RequestLabels = {
  method: string;
  path: string;
};

const requestCounter = metrics.createCounter<RequestLabels>(
  'http_requests_total',
  'Total HTTP requests'
);

// Increment counter
requestCounter.increment({ method: 'GET', path: '/api/users' });

// Increment by specific amount
requestCounter.increment({ method: 'POST', path: '/api/users' }, 5);
```
